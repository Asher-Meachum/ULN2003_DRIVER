# ULN2003 Driver
This is a simple and easily customisable software driver for the ULN2003 stepper motor driver written in Micropython.

## Use the ULN2003 Driver
To use this driver, download ULN2003_DRIVER.py and move into your project folder. You can then use it like a DIY library.

## Hardware
While this should work on any device running Micropython, I have only tested:
- Raspberry Pi Pico (the original one) with the 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor
